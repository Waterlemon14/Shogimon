Welcome to Shogimon!

This project is brought to you by **Eisenhower Aldemita II**, **Abram Josh Marcelo**, **Christopher Senatin**, and **Jose Ernesto Tomanan**.
This shall serve as the game manual.

The bottom player, consisting of non-shiny pieces, serves as Player 1 (and is the first to move), while the top player, consisting of shiny pieces, serves as Player 2.
The pieces of the players change images depending on who the current player is. The active player gets the non-shiny pieces while the idle player gets the shiny pieces.

For each round, each player has 3 actions which can either be used by *moving a piece* (i.e., clicking on the on-board piece and clicking a blue dot, which indicates that they can move there); or by *dropping a captured piece* (i.e., clicking on one of your captures and placing them on one of the blue dots shown on screen).

The game is won by trapping the enemy *Latias* and *Latios* in such a way that it cannot move any further.
Similarly, the game is lost by having your own *Latias* and *Latios* trapped.
Finally, the game ends in a draw if both player's *Latias* and *Latios* are unable to move after a single action.

To start the online (i.e. main) version of the game, run the go server in the project_server directory by running in the terminal:

```
go run .
```

and open 2 instances of **web/index.html**.

The online version of the game can be restarted at after a game verdict has been made by clicking `R`.
