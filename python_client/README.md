Welcome to Shogimon!

This project is brought to you by **Eisenhower Aldemita**, **Abram Josh Marcelo**, **Christopher Senatin**, and **Jose Ernesto Tomanan**.
This shall serve as the game manual.

The bottom player, consisting of non-shiny pieces, serves as Player 1 (and is the first to move), while the top player, consisting of shiny pieces, serves as Player 2.

For each round, each player has 3 actions which can either be used by *moving a piece* (i.e., clicking on the on-board piece and clicking a blue dot, which indicates that they can move there); or by *dropping a captured piece* (i.e., clicking on one of your captures and placing them on one of the blue dots shown on screen).

The game is won by trapping the enemy *Latias* and *Latios* in such a way that it cannot move any further.
Similarly, the game is lost by having your own *Latias* and *Latios* trapped.

To start the offline version of the game, run:

```python
poetry run python src/offline_main.py
```

The offline version is accesible via:

```python
poetry run python src/main.py
```


The offline version of the game can be restarted at any point the program is running by clicking `R`. For the online implementation, a clean restart is needed (clients and the server).
